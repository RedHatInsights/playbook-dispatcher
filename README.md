# Playbook Dispatcher

Playbook Dispatcher is a service for running Ansible Playbooks on hosts connected via [Cloud Connector](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-connector).

Playbook Dispatcher takes care of:

- dispatching the request to run a Playbook
- tracking the progress of a Playbook run

<img alt="Communication diagram" src="./docs/communication.svg" width="50%" />

Playbook Dispatcher consists of 3 parts:

- API, which can be used to dispatch a Playbook or to query it's state
- validator, which validates archives uploaded via ingress service
- response consumer, which processes validated archives and updates the internal state accordingly

## Public REST interface

Information about Playbook runs can be queried using the REST API.

The API is placed behind a [web gateway (3scale)](https://internal.cloud.redhat.com/docs/services/3scale/).
Authentication with the web gateway (basic auth, jwt cookie) is required to access the API.
The API is only accessible to principals of type User (i.e. cert auth is not sufficient).
In addition, the API resources are subject [role based access control](https://internal.cloud.redhat.com/docs/services/rbac/).

The API has rich filtering capabilities and supports client-specific representations using sparse fieldsets.
See [API schema](./schema/public.openapi.yaml) for more details.

## Internal REST interface

In addition to the public REST interface, an internal REST interface is available.
This API can only be accessed from within the cluster where playbook-dispatcher is deployed.

In order to authenticate, the client is required to hold an app-specific pre-shared key and use it in HTTP requests in the `Authorization` header.

```
POST /internal/dispatch HTTP/1.1
Authorization: PSK <pre-shared key>
```

playbook-dispatcher supports multiple pre-shared keys to be configured at the same time.
The keys are configured via environment variables in form of `PSK_AUTH_<service id>=<pre-shared key>` where `service id` identifes the service that's been given the given key and `pre-shared key` is the key itself. For example:
```
PSK_AUTH_REMEDIATIONS=xwKhCUzgJ8 ./app run
```

### Recipient status

One of the operations available in the internal API is the recipient status.
This operation allows the client to obtain connection information for a given set of recipients.

Sample request:
```
POST /internal/v2/recipients/status
[
    {
        "recipient": "35720ecb-bc23-4b06-a8cd-f0c264edf2c1",
        "org_id": "5318290"
    }, {
        "recipient": "73dca8b6-cc11-4954-8f6c-9ecc732ec212",
        "org_id": "5318290"
    }
]
```

Sample response:
```
[
    {
        "recipient": "35720ecb-bc23-4b06-a8cd-f0c264edf2c1",
        "org_id": "5318290",
        "connected": true
    }, {
        "recipient": "73dca8b6-cc11-4954-8f6c-9ecc732ec212",
        "org_id": "5318290",
        "connected": false
    }
]
```

See [API schema](./schema/private.openapi.yaml) for more details.

## Event interface

Services can integrate with Playbook Dispatcher by consuming its event interface.
Playbook Dispatcher emits an event for every state change.
These events are produced to `platform.playbook-dispatcher.runs` topic in Kafka from where integrating services can consume them.

The key of each event is the id of the given playbook run.

The value of each event is described by [a JSON schema](./schema/run.event.yaml).
An event can be of type:

- create - when a new playbook run is created
- update - when the state of a playbook run changes
- delete - when a playbook run is removed
- read - special type of event used to re-populate the topic (i.e. to remind the consumers of the latest state of a given run). This event does not indicate state change but can be used to populate caches, etc.

In addition, each event contains the following headers:

- `event_type` - the type of the event (see above)
- `service` - the service that created the given playbook run
- `status` - current of the playbook run
- `account` - the account (tenant) the given playbook run belong to

The event headers make it possible to filter events without the need to parse the value of each event.

## Expected input format

The service expects the uploaded file to contain Ansible Runner [job events](https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#runner-artifact-job-events-host-and-playbook-events).
Job events should be stored in the [newline-delimited JSON](https://jsonlines.org/) format.
Each line in the file matches one job event.

```jsonl
{"event": "executor_on_start", "uuid": "4533e4d7-5034-4baf-b578-821305c96da4", "counter": -1, "stdout": "", "start_line": 0, "end_line": 0, "event_data": {"dispatcher_correlation_id": "c37278ac-f41c-424a-8461-7f41b4b87c8e"}}
{"event": "playbook_on_start", "uuid": "cb93301e-5ff8-4f75-ade6-57d0ec2fc662", "counter": 0, "stdout": "", "start_line": 0, "end_line": 0}
{"event": "playbook_on_stats", "uuid": "998a4bd2-2d6b-4c31-905c-2d5ad7a7f8ab", "counter": 1, "stdout": "", "start_line": 0, "end_line": 0}
```

The structure of each event is validated using a JSON Schema defined in [ansibleRunnerJobEvent.yaml](./schema/ansibleRunnerJobEvent.yaml).
Note that additional attributes (not defined by the schema) are allowed.

The expected content type of the uploaded file is `application/vnd.redhat.playbook.v1+jsonl` for a plain file or `application/vnd.redhat.playbook.v1+gzip` if the content is compressed.

### Non-standard event types

Besides Ansible Runner event types (`playbook_*` and `runner_*`) the services recognizes two additional event types.

Firstly, `executor_on_start` event type is produced before Ansible Runner is invoked.

```json
{"event": "executor_on_start", "uuid": "4533e4d7-5034-4baf-b578-821305c96da4", "counter": -1, "stdout": "", "start_line": 0, "end_line": 0, "event_data": {
    "crc_dispatcher_correlation_id": "c37278ac-f41c-424a-8461-7f41b4b87c8e"
}}
```

The event carries the correlation id in the `event_data` dictionary.
This identifier is necessary to tie the uploaded file to a Playbook run.

Secondly, `executor_on_failed` event type may be produced should it not be possible to start a Playbook run for some reason.
This may happen e.g. if the Playbook signature is not valid, Ansible Runner binary is not available/executable, etc.

```json
{"event": "executor_on_failed", "uuid": "14f07467-0020-4ab7-a075-d7d8c96d6fdc", "counter": -1, "stdout": "", "start_line": 0, "end_line": 0, "event_data": {
    "crc_dispatcher_correlation_id": "c37278ac-f41c-424a-8461-7f41b4b87c8e",
    "crc_dispatcher_error_code": "SIGNATURE_INVALID",
    "crc_dispatcher_error_details": "Signature \"783701f7599830824fa73488f80eb79894f6f14203264b6a3ac3f0a14012c25f\" is not valid for Play \"run insights to obtain latest diagnosis info\"",
}}
```

Again, the correlation id is defined.
In addition, an error code and detailed information should be provided.

## Cloud Connector integration

Playbook Dispatcher uses [Cloud Connector](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-connector) to invoke Playbooks on connected hosts.
For each Playbook run request it sents the following message to Cloud Connector:

```javascript
{
    "account":"540155",
    "directive":"playbook",
    "recipient":"869fe355-4b69-43f6-82ff-d151dddee472", // id of the cloud connector client
    "metadata":{
        "crc_dispatcher_correlation_id":"e957564e-b823-4047-9ad7-0277dc61c88f", // see Non-standard event types for more details
        "response_interval":"600", // how often the recipient should send back responses
        "return_url":"https://cloud.redhat.com/api/ingress/v1/upload" // URL to post responses to
    },
    // playbook to execute
    "payload": "https://cloud.redhat.com/api/v1/remediations/1234/playbook?hosts=8f876606-5289-47f7-bb65-3966f0ba3ae1"
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisities

- Golang >= 1.14
- docker-compose

### Running the service

Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the service and its dependencies

The API can be accessed at <http://localhost:8000/api/playbook-dispatcher/v1/runs>

```sh
curl -v -H "x-rh-identity: eyJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJpbnRlcm5hbCI6eyJvcmdfaWQiOiI1MzE4MjkwIn0sImFjY291bnRfbnVtYmVyIjoiOTAxNTc4IiwidXNlciI6e30sInR5cGUiOiJVc2VyIn19Cg==" http://localhost:8000/api/playbook-dispatcher/v1/runs
```

Useful commands:

- `make sample_request` can be used to dispatch a new sample Playbook
- `make sample_upload` can be used to upload a sample archive via Ingress

### Running tests

`make test`

### Running Playbooks using the CI environment

1. Log in to insights-dev cluster using `oc` command
1. Modify `examples/payload.json`
    - use the correct account (tenant id)
    - set the recipient to the rhc id of the target host
    - set the URL of the Playbook to execute

1. Start port forwarding by running `make ci-port-forward`
1. Dispatch the playbook run by running `PSK=<pre-shared-key> make ci-dispatch` where `<pre-shared-key>` is replaced with the secret token
